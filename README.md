# Tomb-Raider-Definitive-Edition-editor

This was an unfinished project only MP was added. SP still has to be implemented.

You need to export the profile not the save itself for MP. file should be called SYSTEM.DAT.

The filesize will never change thats why hardcoded offsets are used.

Export this file from SW or JB PS4 simply open it and add what you want for MP.

Massive thank you to Cobra for all his work on this too if it wasnt for him prob wouldnt be made. Hopefully others who enjoy the game might finish it as i just dont have time anymore.

And yes there are still issues with UI placement etc but as i say i just have the time anymore sorry.
